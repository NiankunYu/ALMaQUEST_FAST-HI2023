We post the final FAST spectra for the ALMaQUEST project here. Please caution that some of the spectra is contaminated by RFI, even though the H I emission region is clean. Moreover, there are some supplementary H I specrta from HI-MaNGA. If there is any other questions, please feel free to contact me via niankunyu@bao.ac.cn.
