# The final H I spectra for the ALMaQUEST galaxies is saved in FAST_hi_final.
* The FAST observation setting is shown in 7815_12705_FASTobservation.jpg
* The python code is in .py file, and try to run FAST_onoff_main.py
* onoff_2022.par and observation_2022.txt are the file path and observation settings, respectively.
* The data, KY file and output files are saved in the accordingly spectra.
* If you use this code processing you data, please cite our papers.
